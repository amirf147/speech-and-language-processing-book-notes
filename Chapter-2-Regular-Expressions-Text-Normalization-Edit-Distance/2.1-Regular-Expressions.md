#### Section 2.1: Regular Expressions

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Definition and Purpose:**
   - Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern.
   - They are used for pattern matching within strings, enabling tasks like searching, replacing, and parsing text.

2. **Syntax and Usage:**
   - **Basic Symbols:**
     - `.` (dot) matches any single character except newline.
     - `*` (asterisk) matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character.
     - `+` (plus) matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding character.
     - `?` (question mark) matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding character.
     - `^` matches the start of a line.
     - `$` matches the end of a line.
   - **Character Classes:**
     - `[abc]` matches any one of the characters a, b, or c.
     - `[a-z]` matches any single character in the range from a to z.
     - `[^abc]` matches any character except a, b, or c.
   - **Predefined Character Classes:**
     - `\d` matches any digit.
     - `\w` matches any word character (alphanumeric plus underscore).
     - `\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).

3. **Escaping Special Characters:**
   - Special characters like `.`, `*`, `+`, etc., can be escaped with a backslash (`\`) if they need to be matched literally.

4. **Anchors:**
   - Anchors are used to specify positions in the text, such as the beginning or end of a line.
   - `^` and `$` are common anchors, as mentioned above.

5. **Quantifiers:**
   - Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character or group must be present in the input for a match to be found.
   - `{n}` matches exactly n instances.
   - `{n,}` matches n or more instances.
   - `{n,m}` matches between n and m instances.

6. **Groups and Alternation:**
   - Parentheses `()` are used for grouping.
   - `|` is used for alternation (OR operator).

7. **Applications in NLP:**
   - Regular expressions are fundamental for text processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and parsing.
   - They are also used in search engines, text editors, and various programming languages for string operations.

### Practical Examples:
- **Matching Dates:** To find dates in the format `dd-mm-yyyy`, a regex pattern like `\b\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b` can be used.
- **Email Validation:** An example regex for validating email addresses might look like `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`.
