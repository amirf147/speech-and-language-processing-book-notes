#### Section 2.1: Regular Expressions

**Terms:**

1. **Operator Precedence Hierarchy:**
   - Parentheses > Counters > Sequences and anchors > Disjunction
  
2. **Greedy:**
   - Patterns are considered greedy if they expand to cover as much of a string as they can.
   - **Example:**
     - Pattern: `".*"`
     - String: `"The cat sat on the mat."`
     - Matching: The greedy pattern `".*"` will match the entire string `"The cat sat on the mat."` because it tries to match as much as possible.

3. **Non-Greedy (Lazy):**
   - Patterns are considered non-greedy (or lazy) if they expand to cover as little of a string as they can while still allowing the overall match to succeed.
   - **Example:**
     - Pattern: `".*?"`
     - String: `"The cat sat on the mat."`
     - Matching: The non-greedy pattern `".*?"` will match only the empty string at the start of the string, because it tries to match as little as possible. However, if used in a context that requires more matching (like within other characters), it will match the smallest possible segment:
       - String: `"<div>Content</div>"`
       - Pattern: `"<.*?>"`
       - Matching: The non-greedy pattern `"<.*?>"` will match `"<div>"` and then `"</div>"`, because it tries to match as little as possible between the tags.

### Detailed Example with Context:

**String:** `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`

**Greedy Pattern: `q.*k`**

- **Explanation:** The greedy pattern `q.*k` will match from the first `q` to the last `k` in the string.
- **Matching:** `"quick brown fox jumps over the laz"`, which is the entire substring from the first `q` to the last `k`.

**Non-Greedy Pattern: `q.*?k`**

- **Explanation:** The non-greedy pattern `q.*?k` will match from the first `q` to the first `k` in the string.
- **Matching:** `"quick"`, which is the smallest possible substring from `q` to `k`.
