#### Section 2.1: Regular Expressions

**Terms:**

1. **Operator Precedence Hierarchy:**
   - Parentheses > Counters > Sequences and anchors > Disjunction
  
2. **Greedy:**
   - Patterns are considered greedy if they expand to cover as much of a string as they can.
   - **Example:**
     - Pattern: `".*"`
     - String: `"The cat sat on the mat."`
     - Matching: The greedy pattern `".*"` will match the entire string `"The cat sat on the mat."` because it tries to match as much as possible.

3. **Non-Greedy (Lazy):**
   - Patterns are considered non-greedy (or lazy) if they expand to cover as little of a string as they can while still allowing the overall match to succeed.
