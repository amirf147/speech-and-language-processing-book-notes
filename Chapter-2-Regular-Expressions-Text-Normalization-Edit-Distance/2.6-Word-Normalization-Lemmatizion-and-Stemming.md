### Section 2.6: Word Normalization, Lemmatizion and Stemming

**normalization**: putting words or tokens in a standard format such as in **case folding**

### Section 2.6.1: Lemmatization

**Lemmatiation**: represent all words as their lemma, i.e. their shared root. am, are, is -> be

**Morephemes**:
    - meaning bearing units
    - **stems**: the core meaning bearing unit. cats -> cat
      **affixes**: part that adheres to the stem with a grammatical function. cats -> s

**Stemming: The Porter Stemmer**:
mainly about chopping off the final affixes. series  of rewrite rules run in series: the output of each pass is fed as input to the next pass
accurate->accur
heights->height
sounding->sound
causes errors of over and under generalizing
