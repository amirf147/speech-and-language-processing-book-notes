### Section 2.8: Minimum Edit Distance

**Minimum Edit Distance:**
- **Definition**: The minimum number of editing operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.
- **Applications**: Used in spelling correction, DNA sequence analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition.

**Edit Operations:**
1. **Insertion**: Add a character.
2. **Deletion**: Remove a character.
3. **Substitution**: Replace one character with another.

**Cost Model:**
- Typically, each operation has a cost of 1, but costs can be adjusted depending on the application.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**
- Uses a matrix to compute the minimum edit distance.
- **Matrix Setup**:
  - Rows represent characters of the source string.
  - Columns represent characters of the target string.
  - `D[i,j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of the source and the first `j` characters of the target.

**Recurrence Relation:**
- If `s[i] == t[j]`, then `D[i,j] = D[i-1,j-1]` (no cost).
- Else, `D[i,j] = min(D[i-1,j] + 1,  // deletion
                      D[i,j-1] + 1,  // insertion
                      D[i-1,j-1] + 1) // substitution

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize the first row and column of the matrix.
2. Fill in the matrix using the recurrence relation.
3. The value in `D[m,n]` (bottom-right cell) is the minimum edit distance.

**Example:**
- Transforming "kitten" to "sitting":
  - Insertion of 's': "sitten"
  - Substitution of 'k' to 'i': "sitten"
  - Substitution of 'e' to 'i': "sittin"
  - Insertion of 'g': "sitting"
  - Minimum edit distance = 3

**Key Takeaway:**
- Minimum edit distance provides a quantitative measure of how different two strings are, which is crucial for various computational linguistics tasks.

### Cost Alignment

**Cost Alignment:**
- **Definition**: Assigning costs to different edit operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to reflect the true effort or significance of the changes.
- **Purpose**: To make the edit distance computation more realistic and applicable to specific contexts by assigning different weights to operations.

**Custom Cost Models:**
- Different applications may require different cost models.
  - **Example 1**: In DNA sequence alignment, transitions (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine) might have a lower cost than transversions (purine to pyrimidine or vice versa).
  - **Example 2**: In spelling correction, substituting a frequently confused letter (e.g., 'a' to 'e') might have a lower cost than other substitutions.

**Algorithm Adaptation:**
- Adjust the recurrence relation to include specific costs for each operation:
  - `D[i,j] = min(D[i-1,j] + cost(deletion),  // deletion
                  D[i,j-1] + cost(insertion),  // insertion
                  D[i-1,j-1] + cost(substitution))  // substitution

**Example with Custom Costs:**
- Costs: Insertion = 1, Deletion = 2, Substitution = 3
- Transforming "kitten" to "sitting":
  - Insertion of 's': Cost 1
  - Substitution of 'k' to 'i': Cost 3
  - Substitution of 'e' to 'i': Cost 3
  - Insertion of 'g': Cost 1
  - Total Cost: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8

**Key Takeaway:**
- Cost alignment allows for more nuanced and application-specific measures of string similarity by assigning appropriate costs to different edit operations.

### Backtrace

**Backtrace:**
- **Definition**: A technique used to reconstruct the sequence of edit operations that transform the source string into the target string by tracing back through the dynamic programming matrix.

**Steps for Backtrace:**
1. **Start at the Bottom-Right Cell**:
   - Begin at `D[m,n]` in the matrix, which holds the minimum edit distance.

2. **Trace Back to the Top-Left Cell**:
   - Move to the cell that contributed to the current cell's value based on the operation performed (insertion, deletion, or substitution).

3. **Record the Operations**:
   - **If moving diagonally (`D[i-1,j-1]`)**:
     - If characters match: No operation.
     - If characters differ: Substitution.
   - **If moving up (`D[i-1,j]`)**:
     - Record a deletion.
   - **If moving left (`D[i,j-1]`)**:
     - Record an insertion.

**Example**:
- Transforming "kitten" to "sitting":
  - Matrix path:
    - From `D[6,7]` to `D[0,0]`.
    - Steps: Insert 's', Substitute 'k' with 's', Substitute 'e' with 'i', Insert 'g'.
  - Operations: `[(Insert 's'), (Substitute 'k' with 's'), (Substitute 'e' with 'i'), (Insert 'g')]`.

**Key Takeaway:**
- Backtrace provides the exact sequence of operations needed to transform one string into another, enabling a detailed understanding of the transformation process.
- minimum edit distance is not enough
- we need alignment using backtrace
