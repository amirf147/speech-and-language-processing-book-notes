> What are the prereqs? Prerequisites: CS106B, Python (at the level of CS106A), CS109 (or equivalent background in probability), and programming maturity and knowledge of UNIX equivalent to CS107 (or taking CS107 or CS1U concurrently). In some previous years CS107 and CS109 were optional. Many students advised us that it would have been helpful to have 107 and 109 first. So now both are required. You may take them concurrently, and if you have equivalent knowledge that's fine. It's also useful to have had Math 51, but not required; we'll try to give you pointers to places to make up missing background. Note: We make exceptions for PhD students in other departments who haven't taken 107 and 109, just talk to us!
