so there are continuous and discrete distributions


continuous have infinite values, uncountable





a random variable is the result of an experiment or occurrence that is either part of a continuous or discrete distribution of possible events  that could have occurred


in a continuous distribution:
 - when we talk about probability, we know the parameters , such as the mean or mu of the probability density function, it is a conceptualisation and does not require an observation 
 
 - when we talk about likelihood, it is because we've made an observation, an event has occurred, however, in the real world, we don't actually know the parameters, we do however know the x value within the probability density function. 


in a discrete distribution:
 - when we talk about probability, we know the parameters, such as the bias of a coin flip (50% for example), is a conceptualisation and we can talk about what we will expect if we perform a coin flip with that exact parameter/bias, but we're not dealing with any observed data actually


- when we talk about likelihood, an event has occurred, a coin has been flipped, we can't know the bias of the coin
