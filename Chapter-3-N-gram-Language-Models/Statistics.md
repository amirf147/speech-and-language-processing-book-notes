## Clarification of certain statistics of terms and concepts

### Probability Vs. Likelihood
Source for the following information, most of which is copied verbatim: [YouTube: Brian Greco - Learn Statistics! Probability vs. Likelihood ... MADE EASY!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXGjQnpGGIo)

In the context of **discrete probability distributions** (like coin flips):
 - Probability exists in **one universe**
 - A probability of an event is related to other events that occur in the same universe
 - The probabilities within the universe must all add up to 1
 - Of all those probabilities, one thing **must happen** (clarify?)
 - In probability, we know the _parameters_ which exactly describe the situation and how often things occur
 - Probability and likelihood are really the same thing, from different perspectives
 - Probability =  we know which universe we are in, and the probabilities of all events in that one universe add up to 1.
 - "**In statistics, we often do not know which universe we are in**"
   - "We only observed data, but we don't understand the process that created the data"
 - Likelihood = we know what we observed, and we consider the probability of **what we observed** in any possible universe. 
  
In **normal distributions** (a type of continuous distribution):
 - probability = area under the curve
