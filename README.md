Typically these notes our generated like this:

As I'm reading the text, I jot down things that I think are important or things that I don't know as much I'd like to or things that I don't know at all.

Then I might run that into gpt4o along with some instructions on what I would like to add or clarify or clean up.

So some of the things that you might see that look really clean and organized might be because it's been run through gpt4o.
